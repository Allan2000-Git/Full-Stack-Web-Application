Develop a Web Application for Effective NBA Points Calculation for Academic Institutes

Project Goal:
The goal of this project was to create an innovative Full Stack Web Application tailored for NBA points calculation in educational institutions. The primary objectives were to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and convenience in managing academic processes related to NBA points calculation.

Development Approach:
This project was developed through a collaborative effort, with me leading and managing a cross-functional team. We leveraged modern technology and tools, specifically the MERN Stack. This included using ReactJS for the frontend, Node.js/Express for backend development, and MongoDB as the database solution. The application was designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with a strong focus on data visualization and real-time updates.

Key Features:
1. Comprehensive CRUD Functionality: The application offered a comprehensive set of features for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, ensuring that academic data could be managed seamlessly.
2. Dynamic Data Visualization: Utilizing MongoDB's charting capabilities, we implemented dynamic data visualization, providing valuable insights through charts and graphs.
3. EJS Template Engine: We integrated EJS template engines to display database values, including student marks, on the frontend. This feature enhanced user experience and accessibility.
4. Significant Time Savings: A notable achievement of the project was the remarkable reduction in manual processing time for faculty members. We achieved a 60% reduction, reducing the time required from 5-7 days to a mere 2-3 days, greatly improving operational efficiency.

In summary, this project aimed to streamline NBA points calculation in educational institutions. It was developed using cutting-edge technology and offered features such as CRUD functionality, dynamic data visualization, and significant time savings for faculty, ultimately enhancing academic processes.
